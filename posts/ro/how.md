subtitle: "Discover How Oil Cleansing Transforms Dry, Flaky Skin into Soft, Glowing Complexion Naturally"
intro: "Your face is drier than a stand-up comedian's martini. You've slathered on every \"ultra-hydrating\" cream in Sephora, yet somehow you still look like a lizard in desperate need of lotion. Then someone whispers the forbidden words: \"Just rub oil on it.\" Wait… oil? The thing we've been told is public enemy #1 since 1995? Yes, friend. Welcome to the Oil Cleansing Method (OCM). It's not witchcraft. It's chemistry. And it works."

- "You're probably using way more cleanser than necessary."
- "Exfoliating acids on already compromised dry skin = barrier apocalypse."
- "You keep buying \"non-comedogenic\" products that somehow still feel like rubbing plastic on your face."
- "Winter air + indoor heating = humidity drops to Death Valley levels and your skin cries actual tears (that evaporate instantly)."
solution: "Enter the Oil Cleansing Method: Like Dissolves Like, But Make It Skincare. The principle is simple: oil dissolves oil. The makeup, sunscreen, and sebum stuck in your pores? Also oil-soluble. Gentle plant oils bind to that gunk, lift it out, and help cleanse without the tight, squeaky feeling. No stripping. No crying. Just soft, comfortable skin that doesn't feel like sandpaper."
solutionList:
- "Optional castor oil (0–10% for dry skin, up to 20% for heavier makeup). Skip castor entirely if very dry; use 100% jojoba instead. Carrier oils like jojoba, grapeseed, sunflower, or argan gently dissolve debris and support the lipid barrier.

- "Massaging with oil on dry skin can improve circulation at the surface and help relaxation — giving you that \"I actually slept\" glow. Source - National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (nccih.nih.gov)"
- "Oils rich in linoleic acid (grapeseed, sunflower, safflower) can support barrier repair and hydration in dry or eczema-prone skin. Source - American Academy of Dermatology (aad.org)"
- "No water needed during the initial massage phase = less risk of hot-water–induced lipid loss. Lukewarm or cool water can be used for removal. Source - National Rosacea Society (rosacea.org)"
- "Removes waterproof sunscreen and makeup gently — no tugging or redness."
- "Low-comedogenic oils (like jojoba, argan, grapeseed) may help balance skin without clogging pores, though individual reactions vary."
- "One bottle lasts a long time, depending on usage."
- "Zero microplastics or heavy preservatives — just simple ingredients."
- "Suitable for many dry, sensitive, and mature skin types — though anyone with rosacea should patch test and go slow."
- 🚩Dacă ai pielea sensibilă, alergii, eczeme sau orice altă condiție dermatologică, consultă întotdeauna un dermatolog înainte de a încerca rutine noi — fiecare piele e diferită.
- 🚩Dacă observi iritație, arsură, roșeață, mâncărime sau orice reacție neobișnuită, oprește imediat și cere sfat medical.

- {do: "Apply to completely dry skin: blend of optional castor (0–10% for dry, up to 20% for makeup) + jojoba/grapeseed/sunflower oil (start 1:3 or 0:4 ratio for very dry skin)", dont: "Use foaming cleansers with strong surfactants like SLS — they can be too stripping for dry skin"}
- {do: "Massage oil for 1–2 minutes like you're giving your face a spa day (dry hands/skin first)", dont: "Scrub like you're sanding furniture"}
- {do: "Remove with a warm damp or dry microfiber cloth (emulsify with splashes at end if needed), or lukewarm water if necessary", dont: "Blast your face with hot water like you're pressure-washing a driveway"}
- {do: "Pat dry gently — leaving a little oil film behind is fine", dont: "Wipe aggressively until your skin squeaks"}
- {do: "Cleanse with oil only at night (a morning water rinse is enough)", dont: "Double cleanse with micellar water AND a foaming cleanser unless your skin truly needs it"}
- {do: "Patch test new oils (forearm, 24h)", dont: "Dump straight tea tree oil on your face because 'natural = safe'"}
- {do: "Adjust ratios — start low with castor (10–20%) if heavier makeup, increase gradually; skip castor if very dry", dont: "Use 100% castor oil unless you want your face to feel like aged leather"}

faqList:
- {question: "Will oil cleansing make me break out?", answer: "It can if you use highly comedogenic oils (like coconut or wheat germ) or don't remove the oil properly. Stick to low-comedogenic options like jojoba, grapeseed, safflower, or hemp seed. Individual reactions vary, so patch test first."}
- {question: "I have dry skin — which oils should I use?", answer: "For dry skin, start with 0–1 part castor oil + 3–4 parts grapeseed, sunflower, jojoba, or argan oil. Skip castor entirely if extremely dry/reactive — apply to completely dry skin only."}
- {question: "Do I still need moisturizer after?", answer: "Many people with dry skin feel comfortable without extra moisturizer after oil cleansing (leftover film acts as an occlusive), but if your skin feels tight, layer a light hydrating serum or a few drops of squalane."}
- {question: "Can I do this if I wear heavy makeup?", answer: "Yes! Increase castor oil slightly for more cleansing power (up to 1:2 ratio), or follow with a gentle second cleanse if needed."}
- {question: "Is it safe for sensitive/rosacea skin?", answer: "Often, yes — but go slow. Choose a simple oil like jojoba or argan, patch test first, avoid hot water/rough cloths, and try dry or lukewarm cloth removal."}
- {question: "How long until I see results?", answer: "Skin comfort can improve within days. Barrier support typically becomes noticeable over 2–4 weeks, depending on how damaged your skin was — avoid over-cleansing."}
- {question: "Who should avoid OCM?", answer: "People with fungal acne-prone skin (Malassezia) may need to avoid certain oils like coconut or olive oil, as these can worsen breakouts."}
