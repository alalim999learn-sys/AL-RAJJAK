problemTitle: "Why Do Teenagers Get More Acne in Winter?"
problemList:
  - Indoor heating + cold wind destroys the skin’s natural barrier
  - Skin produces extra oil to compensate → pores get clogged faster
  - Heavy scarves & hats trap sweat and bacteria
  - Holiday sweets & hot chocolate spike hormones and insulin
  - Teens often skip washing face because “it’s too cold”

solutionList:
  - Morning Lukewarm water rinse → 30-second raw honey cleanse → pure aloe vera gel
  - Evening Oil cleanse (jojoba or sweet almond) → raw honey wash → diluted apple cider vinegar toner
  - 2–3× weekly Bentonite clay + ACV mask for 10 minutes
  - Moisturize with aloe vera gel + 2 drops tea tree oil
  - Drink 2.5–3 L water + 1–2 cups green tea daily

  - { do: "Use raw honey as a gentle antibacterial cleanser", dont: "Use foaming cleansers with SLS/SLES" }
  - { do: "Moisturize with pure aloe vera gel", dont: "Heavy cream moisturizers that clog pores" }
  - { do: "Clay mask 2–3 times per week", dont: "Daily scrubbing or exfoliating" }
  - { do: "Change pillowcase every 2 days", dont: "Sleep on the same pillow for weeks" }
  - { do: "Diluted tea tree oil as spot treatment", dont: "Undiluted tea tree – burns skin" }

routineList:
  -  Oil cleanse (evening only) – 60 seconds
  -  Raw honey face wash – morning & night
  -  Apple cider vinegar toner (1 part ACV  4 parts water)
  -  Aloe vera + tea tree moisturizer
  -  Clay mask 2–3× per week

    answer: "100% yes – it’s fast (under 5 minutes) and extremely effective for boys too."
  - question: "Why does acne get worse in winter even when I wash my face?"
    answer: "Because cold + dry air damages the moisture barrier → skin overproduces oil → instant clogged pores."
