problemTitle: "Why Winter Hates Teen Skin (The Cold, Hard Truth)"
problemList:
  - "Cold air holds less moisture, so your skin literally dries out faster in winter."
  - "Indoor heating sucks humidity out of the air like a vampire with a straw."
  - "Hot showers feel amazing but strip natural oils from your skin, making dryness worse."
  - "Wind acts like nature’s exfoliator — but the aggressive kind that leaves you raw."
  - "Low humidity reduces the skin barrier’s ability to retain water. According to the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD), when humidity drops below 30%, transepidermal water loss (TEWL) increases dramatically. [Source: aad.org/public/everyday-care/skin-care-basics/care/winter-skin-care]
  - " Harsh soaps destroy the skin’s acid mantle (pH 4.5–5.5), letting moisture escape. The National Eczema Association explains that a damaged barrier leads to dryness and irritation. [Source: nationaleczema.org/eczema/causes-and-triggers-of-eczema]
  - " Teens produce more sebum naturally, but winter overrides that. A study from the Journal of Investigative Dermatology shows cold temperatures slow down oil gland activity. [Referenced via AAD summary]
  - " Frequent hand washing + cold weather = cracked knuckles. The CDC notes that alcohol-based sanitizers worsen dryness by dissolving lipids in the skin. [Source: cdc.gov/handwashing]
  - "You keep touching your face with cold, dry hands — hello, irritation central."

solution: "Your 9-Step Winter Skin Survival Plan (That Actually Works)"
solutionList:
  - "Switch to lukewarm showers (hot water = enemy #1)."
  - "Pat — don’t rub — your skin dry. Leave it slightly damp before moisturizing."
  - "Use a thick, fragrance-free cream or ointment within 3 minutes of getting out of the shower."
  - "Run a humidifier in your room (aim for 40–50% humidity)."
  - "**Science-backed:** Occlusive ingredients like petrolatum reduce TEWL by up to 99%, according to the American Academy of Dermatology. Look for ointments with petrolatum or dimethicone. [Source: aad.org/public/everyday-care/skin-care-secrets/routine/safely-moisturize-after-washing]
  - "Science-backed: Ceramides are lipids that repair the skin barrier. The National Eczema Association recommends ceramide-containing moisturizers for dry winter skin. [Source: nationaleczema.org/eczema/treatment/moisturizing]
  - "Science-backed: Hyaluronic acid holds 1000x its weight in water. Pair it with an occlusive on top to lock it in (the “slugging lite” method). Studies show HA + occlusive is more effective than either alone. [Referenced in AAD moisturizer guide]
  - "Science-backed:Gentle, fragrance-free cleansers preserve the skin’s microbiome and acid mantle. The AAD recommends creamy or oil-based cleansers in winter. [Source: aad.org/public/everyday-care/skin-care-basics/care/face-washing-101]
  - "Wear cotton-lined gloves when you go outside and apply hand cream before putting them on."

comparisonTitle: "Winter Skin Rules for Teens: DO vs DON’T"
comparisonTable:
  - { DO: "Apply moisturizer on damp skin", DON’T: "Apply on bone-dry skin" }
  - { DO: "Use thick cream or ointment", DON’T: "Use watery lotion" }
  - { DO: "Choose fragrance-free everything", DON’T: "Use scented products" }
  - { DO: "Pat skin dry gently", DON’T: "Rub hard with towel" }
  - { DO: "Take 5-minute lukewarm showers", DON’T: "Take long hot showers" }
  - { DO: "Run a humidifier at night", DON’T: "Sleep in dry heated air" }
  - { DO: "Wear sunscreen daily", DON’T: "Skip SPF in winter" }
  - { DO: "Reapply lip balm often", DON’T: "Lick or pick chapped lips" }

routineList:
  - "Morning → Gentle creamy cleanser → Hyaluronic acid serum (optional) → Thick moisturizer with ceramides → Sunscreen (yes, even in winter!)"
  - "Night → Same cleanser → Same moisturizer (or ointment on extra-dry days) → Optional slugging with plain petrolatum 2–3 nights a week"
  - "Hands & Lips → Keep a tube of cream in every backpack pocket and apply literally every time you think about it."
  - "Shower rule → Max 5–7 minutes, lukewarm water, moisturize immediately after."

faqList:
  - question: "Can I still use my acne face wash in winter?"
    answer: "Yes, but switch to a gentler one if it has benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid higher than 2%. Those dry you out extra in cold weather."
  - question: "Is vaseline on the face gross?"
    answer: "Only if you use too much. A thin layer at night = glass skin by morning. Just don’t cake it on before school."
  - question: "My lips are cracked and bleeding — help!"
    answer: "Stop licking them (your saliva dries them more). Use a thick balm with lanolin or petrolatum multiple times a day."
  - question: "Do I really need a humidifier?"
    answer: "If your room feels like the Sahara when you wake up, yes. A $30 cool-mist one from anywhere works wonders."
  - question: "I play winter sports — my cheeks are windburned and hurt."
    answer: "Apply a thick layer of ointment 20 minutes before going outside. Wear a scarf or balaclava. Your skin will thank you."
  - question: "Is drinking more water enough?"
    answer: "Hydrating inside helps, but it won’t fix topical dryness. You still need to trap the moisture on your skin."
